 I. Project Creation and Code Setup
 * Create Project:
   * File \rightarrow New Project (Give project Name)
   * Next \rightarrow Next \rightarrow New Source
   * Select VHDL Module (Give File Name) \rightarrow Next
 * Define Port Pins:
   * Provide pin out from code (Inputs, Outputs, and Buses)
   * Next \rightarrow Finish \rightarrow Next \rightarrow Yes \rightarrow Finish \rightarrow Next \rightarrow Yes
 * Write VHDL Code:
   * Write the complete Shift Register logic in the .vhd file.
II. Synthesis and Simulation (Verification)
 * Synthesize Design (XST):
   * Go to Synthesis - XST (double click on it) \rightarrow Yes
   * Check Syntax
   * Go to RTL (to view the Register-Transfer Level schematic).
 * Create Test Bench:
   * Go to the Behavioral (.vhd) file, right-click \rightarrow New source
   * Select Test Bench waveform
   * Give file name \rightarrow Next \rightarrow Next \rightarrow Finish
   * Select single clock.
 * Setup Waveform:
   * Click on the blue box for select lines \rightarrow Save.
 * Simulate Behavioral Model:
   * Select behavioral simulation from sources for the Test Bench (.tbw file).
   * Go to Process \rightarrow ISE Simulator
   * Double-click on Simulate behavioral.
III. Implementation and Hardware Download
 * Assign Pin Constraints:
   * Select Synthesis/Implementation from sources for the main design file.
   * Go to Process \rightarrow User Constraints \rightarrow Assign Package pins (double click)
   * Yes \rightarrow Assign from port \rightarrow Save \rightarrow Minimize
 * Implement Design:
   * Go to Process \rightarrow Implement design (double click)
   * \rightarrow Generate Programming file (Double click).
 * Connect and Download to Hardware:
   * Connect to hardware.
   * Locate the generated .bit file (programming file).
   * Copy the .bit file and paste it into the designated FPGA download folder/location.
   * Go to FPGA download & right click to edit
   * Give name of bit file \rightarrow Save
   * Double click on FPGA download (to initiate the configuration).
